# Big Sus on my X570 Taichi

## Notes to self:

- Microphone and line in inputs do not work and will never work
- Try to not screw up the EFI
- We missin' motherboard sensors ay
- We missin' thunderbolt but I am poor and can't afford the expansion card

## Honorable mentions:

- Alessandro Zanardi for rebuilding the EFI from scratch because I am dumb
- Baronerosso @ GitHub for finding the USB mapping nobody actually wanted to do

## Relevant build details:

- ASRock X570 Taichi
- AMD Ryzen 7 3800XT
- AMD Radeon RX 580 8GB
- Booting from a SATA SSD: Samsung 870 EVO 500GB

## Final thoughts:

La madonna maiala
